Here are some interesting data:\nFor most UX teams, Web projects dominated their project portfolio in 2020, with 72% working on Web applications, 54% on Web sites, and 19% on intranets. Mobile-app projects were the focus of 57% of UX teams.\nThe great majority of respondents (71%) worked in house in 2020, while the remaining 29% of respondents worked as consultants (12%), at an agency (10%), or did freelance work (5%). Only 33% of respondents’ in-house UX teams worked with external agencies in 2020. In most cases, their use of external agencies for UX projects either remained unchanged (42%) or declined (33%), in comparison to previous years. When companies did work with agencies, they relied on them primarily for UX research (33%), visual interface–design (33%), and usability-testing (30%) projects—as has been typical in the past.",
